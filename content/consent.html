      <b>Protocol:Behavioral study to understand human attention and learning</b>
  </p>

  <p style="color:black;">
      Welcome! You are invited to participate in a research study investigating human behavior, cognition, and attention. The study intends to collect your responses as you complete various types of tasks or surveys. <br>

      To help you make an informed decision about whether or not you would like to participate, this form provides information about the study’s purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits. <br>Please take time to review the consent before starting the experiment.
      If and when you are ready, click on “I consent and accept this HIT”, which indicates that you voluntarily accept to participate in the study. If you have questions about the experiment in general, you may contact the Cognition, Attention, and Brain Lab in University of Chicago Department of Psychology at (773) 795-0766 or cablab.uchicago@gmail.com.<br>
      If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, you may contact Social & Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board at University of Chicago at (773) 834-7835 or sbs-irb@uchicago.edu.

       <b><u>What is the purpose of this study?</u></b> <br>
       This study will help us understand how people pay attention while learning.
       By combining behavioral tasks and questionnaires, we hope to understand how processes including attention, memory, and perception interact with each other, differ across people, and change over time.
   </p>

   <p style="color:black;">
       <b><u>What will I be doing today, and how long will it take?</u></b> <br>
       During this study, you will watch or read visual stimuli (e.g., film clips, story prompts, images, words, geometric shapes) presented on a computer monitor, and/or hear auditory stimuli (e.g., narrated stories, songs, natural sounds, simple beeps) through headphones or speakers.
       You will respond according to the task instructions via button press, or typing.
       You may also be asked to complete questionnaires. The study will last 1 hour or less. If you decide to withdraw, data collected up until the point of withdrawal may still be included in analysis.
   </p>

   <p style="color:black;">
       <b><u>What are the potential benefits and risks? </u></b> <br>
       Taking part in this research study may not benefit you personally, but we may learn new things that could help others.
       Your participation in this study does not involve any risk to you beyond that of everyday life.
   </p>

   <p style="color:black;">
       <b><u>Will my personal information remain confidential?</u></b> <br>
       The researchers will not know your name, and no identifying information will be connected to your survey answers in any way.
       The survey is therefore anonymous. However, your account is associated with an MTurk number that the researcher has to be able to see in order to pay you, and in some cases these numbers are associated with public profiles which could, in theory, be searched.
       For this reason, though the researcher will not be looking at anyone’s public profiles, the fact of your participation in the research (as opposed to your actual survey responses) is technically considered “confidential” rather than truly anonymous.
   </p>

   <p style="color:black;">
       <b><u>How will you protect the information you collect about me, and how will that information be shared? </u></b> <br>
       All of your responses will be held in strict confidence. Identifiable data will not be stored or shared with other colleagues or funding sources, and only the de-identified data will be protected on a secure server. De-identified information from this study may be used for future research studies or shared with other researchers or funding sources for future research without your additional informed consent.
