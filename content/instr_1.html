        In this experiment, you will see shapes with stripes in different orientations and spatial frequencies (stripes with different distances in between). <br>
        There are two ways we will present the shapes – unframed and framed. <br>

        If you just see a unframed circle, regardless of the orientation and frequency of the stripes, please press <span style="color: #ff0000"><b><kbd> G </kbd></b></span>on your keyboard. <br>
        If you just see a unframed square, regardless of the orientation and frequency of the stripes, please withhold your response and do not press any keys. <br>
        However, when you see a square or circle surrounded by a colored frame, it is your job to figure out the correct key to press. <br>
        Notice the orientations and spatial frequencies in these color-framed shapes.
        Remember that the correct answers come from the key <span style="color: #ff0000"><b><kbd> X </kbd></b></span> or <span style="color: #ff0000"><b><kbd> M </kbd></b></span>.<br>
        We will provide you feedback on your responses to these framed shapes.<br>
        In other words, you should figure out when to press  <span style="color: #ff0000"><b><kbd> X </kbd></b></span> and when to press  <span style="color: #ff0000"><b><kbd> M </kbd></b></span> through trial and error.
