    <p style="color:white;"> Welcome! <br>
    In this experiment, you will see a series of shapes with stripes in different orientations and spatial frequencies (stripes with distances in between). <br>
    If you see a circle, regardless of the orientation and frequency of the stripes, please press <kbd> G </kbd>. <br>
    If you see a square, regardless of the orientation and frequency of the stripes, please withhold your response and do not press any keys. <br>
    However, when you see a square or circle surrounded by a colored frame, it is your job to figure out the correct key to press. <br>
    Notice the orientations and spatial Frequencies in these color-framed trials.<br>
    The correct answers come from <kbd> X </kbd> or <kbd> M </kbd>. <br>
    We will provide you feedback on your response. <br>
    In other words, you should figure out when to press <kbd> A </kbd> and when to press <kbd> L </kbd> through trial and error. </p></b>
